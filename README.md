# UAT-CSC-Assignment-5
# Background
After graduating UAT, you are hired as a coder for the CIA.
The current automated programs that the CIA uses to decode enemy transmissions have always worked well until recently. 
Recently the enemy is using single scrambled low-tech keywords to signal other enemies to start attacks which our current code 
decryption programs have not been successful against.  At the CIA they are developing a new code breaking team which relies on 
human expertise to detect these low tech scrambled keywords. We are turning back the clock with this new team of human code breakers.  
You have been assigned at the CIA to code a simple Code Breaker Training Simulation Program for CIA Recruits called Keywords.
To do this, you go back and study the word jumble program in Chapter 3 of your textbook. This is the program you will use to 
base your Code Breaker Training Simulation Program for CIA Recruits called Keywords on.

# Requirements
* By hand, choose 10 single code words of your choice, and write down a hint for each word.
* Create a new C++ project called Keywords
* This Code Breaker Training Simulation Program should give the user directions and tell them what it is and how to use it based of the background description above.
* Then your Code Breaker Training Simulation Program should randomly select 3 of the 10 words that are coded in your program.
* Your code breaker will scramble each word on the fly and different each run randomly.
* Now make the user try to solve each one of the three randomly picked coded word from your random list.
* Each turn you should give your user feedback on if they got the guess correct or not.
* You should also offer the user help.
* At the end, you should display their stats and ask if they would like to try again.
* After you have a project, publish your code to a new GitHub repository.

# Submission
* Print screen 1 play of your simulation and submit the image file.
* Print screen your GitHub repository after you have finished your project and submit it.
* Submit the .CPP file
* Do not zip these files.
* Do not submit the .sln file
* Do not submit other project files.
